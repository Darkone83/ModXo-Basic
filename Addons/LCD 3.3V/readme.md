![alt_image](https://github.com/Darkone83/ModXo-Basic/blob/main/Images/DC%20logo.png)

A simple breakout board for the ModXo-Basic's disp connector. This board breaks out all signals plus 5V 3.3V and GND.

This board will only work if your DISP Voltage is set to 5V!

##### Builders Notes:

R1 and R2 are 0805 10ohm resistors and are required for New Haven OLED displays. Other displays are optional.
